- GPT-2 was released by OpenAI in 2019 with a blog post, paper, and code on GitHub
- The GPT-2 model series consists of models of different sizes, with the 124M model being the smallest
- The 124M model has 12 layers in the Transformer and 768 channels/dimensions
- The video will focus on reproducing this 124M model from scratch",
